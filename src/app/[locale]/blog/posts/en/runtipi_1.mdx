# Getting Started with Runtipi: A Personal Journey into Self-Hosting

As someone who's spent countless hours tinkering with self-hosted services, I'm excited to share my experience with Runtipi - a tool that's revolutionizing how we manage home servers.

## What is Runtipi?

[Runtipi](https://runtipi.io/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi) homeserver orchestrator that's been making waves in the self-hosting community. Think of it as your friendly neighborhood Docker manager, but with a sleek web interface that doesn't require a PhD in container orchestration to use.

## Why I Chose Runtipi

After years of manually managing Docker containers and fighting with configuration files, I found myself looking for a simpler solution. That's when I discovered Runtipi. What caught my attention was its focus on simplicity without sacrificing functionality.

## Installation Guide (The Secure Way)

Before we dive in, let's talk security. I've learned (sometimes the hard way) that proper setup is crucial.

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or higher (my personal recommendation)
- At least 4GB RAM (8GB if you want to run multiple services smoothly)
- 10GB+ free disk space
- A cup of coffee â˜•

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. First, ensure your system is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

2. Install Runtipi using the official installer:

```bash
curl -L https://setup.runtipi.io | bash
```

### Security Best Practices

Here's what I always recommend to my fellow self-hosters:

1. **Never** expose Runtipi directly to the internet
2. If using a VPS, always:
   - Set up a proper firewall (ufw for exemple)
   - Use a VPN (like Tailscale) for access or [cloudflare tunnels](https://decloudflare.crimeflare.eu.org/#deCloudflare=readme/en.md)
   - Keep ports closed by default

### Docker Considerations

One thing I learned the hard way: if you already have Docker installed, make sure it's the official version. Here's a pro tip:

```bash
docker compose version
```

If that command fails, you'll need to install the Docker Compose plugin first.

## Final Thoughts

While Runtipi makes self-hosting incredibly accessible, remember that with great power comes great responsibility. Always prioritize security, keep your system updated, and join the community discussions if you need help.

*Stay safe and happy self-hosting!*
